    Create an object called employee with the following:
    properties
        weeklyHours - [7,6,7,7] => Each element represents a single shift's length
    methods
        getTotalHours() - this will return the total number of hours from the weeklyHours array.
        addShift(shiftLength)   - this should add the incoming argument to the weeklyHours array and return "Shift added."
                                - before the number is added, it should make sure that in doing this,
                                  the employee won't exceed 5 shifts or 40 hours.
                                  If this happens, do not add the number, and return "Shift limit exceeded."
